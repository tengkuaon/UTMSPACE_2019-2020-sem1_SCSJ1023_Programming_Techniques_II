## SCSJ1023 Programming Techniques II
Source code and other relevant files for the SCSJ1023 Programming Techniques II class I'm taking in my computer science bachelor's degree course at [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](http://www.utm.my/) during the first semester of the 2019-2020 session.

*Compiled with [GCC 9.1.0](https://gcc.gnu.org) on a machine running [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), my favorite Linux distro at this time. Source files for each program are contained in the program's own subfolder. While the class uses [TDM-GCC 4.9.2](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) as compiler with [Orwell Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) as IDE, I had set up my own environment, [GCC 9.1.0](https://gcc.gnu.org) within [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/), with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).*
