## SCSJ1023 Programming Techniques II
Source code and other relevant files for the SCSJ1023 Programming Techniques II class I'm taking in my computer science bachelor's degree course at [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](http://www.utm.my/) during the first semester of the 2019-2020 session.

*Compiled and tested with [GCC 9.1.0](https://gcc.gnu.org), [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) for detecting memory leaks, all on a machine running [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/), my favorite Linux distro at the time. Source files for each program contained in the program's own subfolder.*

*During class sessions, [TDM-GCC 4.9.2](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/) as compiler with [Orwell Dev-C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/orwelldevcpp/) as IDE were used. However, I had my own development setup, [GCC 9.1.0](https://gcc.gnu.org) as compiler installed in an [MSYS2](http://www.msys2.org/) environment, with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as IDE.*
